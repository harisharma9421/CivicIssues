# SmartCivic — Civic Engagement & Accountability Platform

**Tagline:** Smart reporting. Faster action. Transparent outcomes.

## 🔥 What is SmartCivic?
A modern, scalable civic‑tech platform that transforms citizen complaints into measurable city action. Not just logging — it’s a civic collaboration engine with AI, analytics, and multi-channel access.

## 🧭 Core Modules (Quick)

**Citizen Mobile App**
- Photo / video / voice / text reports  
- Auto‑location (GPS) & multilingual UI  
- Real‑time submission, tracking & push/SMS updates

**Admin Dashboard**
- Live map & heatmap of reports  
- Filter, route, escalate, assign & SLA timers  
- Monthly PDF exports and performance metrics

**Backend & APIs**
- Cloud‑scale backend for multimedia and integrations  
- REST + GraphQL, secure auth, media storage

---

## ✨ Enhancements (Make it sticky)
- Gamification: points, badges, leaderboards  
- Community features: upvotes, comments, "follow" issues  
- AI modules: image classification (potholes, garbage), priority prediction, spam detection  
- IoT integration: smart bins, streetlight sensors, CCTV anomaly feeds  
- Multichannel: WhatsApp bot, IVR, SMS, web

---

## 🛡️ Admin & Super‑Admin Workflow (Strict)
- **Single Super Admin** — preconfigured, only role that can approve/remove admins.  
- **Admin Onboarding** — admins register with Aadhaar, DOB, credentials → **pending approval** until Super Admin validates.  
- RBAC enforces clear separation of Super Admin / Admin / Citizen abilities.  
- Admin actions (reject, reassign) must include mandatory reason & audit log.

## 🧱 Suggested Tech Stack (Minimal, scalable)
- **Mobile:** Flutter (cross‑platform)  
- **Web:** React + Leaflet/Mapbox  
- **Backend:** Node.js (NestJS) or FastAPI (Python)  
- **DB:** PostgreSQL + PostGIS, Redis, Elasticsearch  
- **Storage:** S3 (AWS) / GCS  
- **AI:** TensorFlow / PyTorch for models  
- **Infra:** Docker + Kubernetes, GitHub Actions CI/CD

---

## ⚡ Key Integrations
- City ERP & payment gateways  
- Twilio / Gupshup (WhatsApp, SMS), FCM (push)  
- IoT sensors & CCTV streams  
- Public Open Data portal / transparency dashboard

---

## 📈 Quick Deployment Blueprint
1. Separate infra for media storage (S3) and DB (managed RDS).  
2. Containerize services; deploy on Kubernetes (GKE/EKS).  
3. Use CDN + signed URLs for media.  
4. Provision monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana) and logs (ELK).  
5. Set up automated model retraining pipeline for AI modules.

---

## 📋 API & Data Privacy Notes
- All endpoints require HTTPS and token‑based auth (JWT/OAuth2).  
- Store only hashed sensitive fields; encrypt PII at rest.  
- Audit logs for admin actions and admin onboarding flows.  
- Data retention & public dashboards must follow local RTI/privacy rules.

## 🎯 Vision (One‑liner)
A transparency‑first civic engagement platform that converts citizen signals into trusted, trackable, and accountable city action.
